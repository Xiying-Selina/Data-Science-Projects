# Overview
In this retail transaction project, we first identify the primary key of the table. The target column is determined to be 'Quantity', and it appears to be a regression machine learning problem. We examine the distribution of the 'Quantity' column and evaluate its potential impact on the prediction goal, also checking for outliers. Next, we generate datetime features (day, month, year) from the 'Date' column. We analyze the correlation between price and quantity numerical features, comment on the correlation strength, and generate histograms for price to assess skewness and the presence of outliers. If skewed, we perform suitable transformations on these numeric variables and visualize their relationship with the target variable using bar charts, considering the presence of outliers. Additionally, we investigate the cardinality and rare values of at least two categorical features, discussing whether they are ordinal or nominal. For feature engineering, we create at least one text-based feature from the 'Product Name' column. NaN values are handled, and the approach is justified in the notebook. Finally, we develop an ML model to predict the quantity sold and report its performance on the test data.
