# Overview
In this housing prediction project, we first conduct feature selection by loading the dataset and splitting it into train and test sets. We use correlation matrices and scatter plots to identify the top 5 most relevant features for predicting the target variable, creating a new dataset with only these features. In Task 2, we apply Linear Regression to the selected features, evaluating its performance on the test dataset using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score, and visualize the model's performance. Task 3 involves applying L1 and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and improve the model's performance. We train Ridge Regression with L2 regularization and Lasso Regression with L1 regularization, comparing their performance with the Linear Regression model. In Task 4, we use GridSearchCV to find the best lambda values for Ridge and Lasso Regression models, and then evaluate their performance on the test dataset using MSE and R-squared score. Ultimately, we compare the performance of all models to determine the most effective approach for housing price prediction.
