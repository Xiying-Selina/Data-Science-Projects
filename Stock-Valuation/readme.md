# Overview
The project involves examining how stocks perform in diverse industries and using this analysis to devise an investment strategy using **SAS**. As a part of this initiative, we selected 50 companies from five industries and evaluated whether each stock is undervalued, fairly valued, or overvalued in its respective industry. The primary goal is to identify the most undervalued stocks across all industries and create an investment portfolio using these stocks.
