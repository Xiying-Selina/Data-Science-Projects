# Summary
In this data analysis and modeling project, we first import essential packages like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. Next, we read the dataset and explore variables related to the target variable "promoted," presenting visualizations like boxplots, histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots. We preprocess the data by handling missing values, duplicates, categorical columns, and skewed distributions. Then, we fit error-based (Linear or Logistic Regression), Tree-based, and KNN models using scikit-learn, evaluating their performance with appropriate metrics. We justify our choice of performance metrics for each model. To streamline the process, we employ scikit-learn's Pipeline and Column Transformer for data preprocessing and model fitting. Finally, we report the best model's performance on test data, drawing conclusions about which model is optimal for predicting employee promotions.
