# Data-Science-Projects
This repository records selected projects I have done during 9-month study in MSBA at UIUC. Thanks to my professors and my teammates who worked with me. This has been a wonderful journey.

# Project List
1. **Yelp Data Analysis**: performed analysis on Yelp review to help start a new restaurant. keywords: **json, MySQL, SQL, Pandas, Numpy**.
2. **KNIME**: created two KNIME workflows to solve two business problems. keywords: **KNIME, API, MongoDB**.
3. **ChatGPT Twitter Analysis**: implemented by the big data infrastructure using the selected technologies, such as programming language like **Python**, and big data frameworks like **Hadoop, Spark, and RDD**.
4. **HR Prediction, Home Credit Default Risk, Housing Prediction, Retail Transactions**: predictive models using **Python**
- **HR Prediction**: In this data analysis and modeling project, we first import essential packages like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. Next, we read the dataset and explore variables related to the target variable "promoted," presenting visualizations like boxplots, histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots. We preprocess the data by handling missing values, duplicates, categorical columns, and skewed distributions. Then, we fit Logistic Regression, Tree-based model, and KNN models using scikit-learn, evaluating their performance with appropriate metrics. We justify our choice of performance metrics for each model. To streamline the process, we employ scikit-learn's Pipeline and Column Transformer for data preprocessing and model fitting. Finally, we report the best model's performance on test data, drawing conclusions about which model is optimal for predicting employee promotions.
- **Home Credit Default Risk**:
- **Housing Prediction**:
- **Retail Transactions**: 
6. **Health Insurance Lead Prediction**: predictive model using **R**
7. **Stock Valuation**: examining how stocks perform in diverse industries and using this analysis to devise an investment strategy using **SAS**.
8. **Supply Chain Analysis**: supply chain analysis using **R language**, inclusing **EDA, Regression, Time Series, ML models and linear programming**

# Other projects:
There are some projects in other format. The **Other.md** records them as links or screen shots.
- **NFT Dashboards**: Created two dashboards using advanced **sql** queries of two NFTs, Fidenza and Secret Skellies Society. 
- **Tableau Project**: Performed analysis on four streaming platforms, Netflix, Huluon, Disney and Amazon Prime using **Tableau**.
