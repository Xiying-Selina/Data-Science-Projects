# Overview
As the application with the fastest user-growing speed in history (reaching 1 million users in 5 days), ChatGPT has been a hot topic in 2023. As millions of tweets discuss such a disruptive technology, this project conducted a sentiment analysis to find trend topics and peopleâ€™s attitudes towards this innovative technology. 
This project used a dataset from Twitter containing 500,000 tweets about ChatGPT from January to March 2023. [Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khalidryder777/500k-chatgpt-tweets-jan-mar-2023) The data was preprocessed by changing the date format and removing unnecessary symbols and redundancies. Several analysis tools were used on the data set, including **Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA)** and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** for uncovering hidden topics and understanding popular trends, unigram, bigram, and trigrams for most frequently used words, and Vader for **sentiment analysis**. Several keywords related to artificial intelligence and machine learning were counted, top influencers were discovered, and public opinions toward ChatGPT were analyzed in this study. Possible assumptions and implications from these trends and attitudes were also discussed. 

# Methods
This project was implemented by the big data infrastructure using the selected technologies, such as programming language like Python, and big data frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, and RDD.
