# NFT dashboards
In this project, we created two dashboards using **advanced sql** queries of two NFTs, Fidenza and Secret Skellies Society. 

[Fidenza](https://app.flipsidecrypto.com/dashboard/team-17-miniproject-2-fidenza-analysis-IUTFYP);
Fidenza is a curated generative art NFT project out of the ArtBlocks initiative. Although the program stays focused on structured curves and blocks, the varieties of scale, organization, texture, and color usage it can employ create a wide array of generative possibilities.

[Secret Skellies Society](https://app.flipsidecrypto.com/dashboard/team-17-miniproject-2-secret-skellies-society-analysis-NwOGXM);
Secret Skellies Society minted in Jan 2022. By April 2022, it became the 8th most traded NFT.
