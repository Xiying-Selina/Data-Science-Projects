# Overview
In this course, we basically covered four assignments related to supply chain analysis using **R language**. 
* **Assignment1**: In this assignment, we estimated factors associated with the productivity of garment manufacturing workers, in which we covered data processing, EDA, and regression anaysis.
* **Assignment2**: In this assignment, we are going to investigate the relative merits and demerits of aggregate forecasting versus disaggregated forecasting. We used graphical comparison, LASSO models and Time series prediction models â€“ Auto Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) on both aggregated and disaggregated demand. 
* **Assignment3**: In this assignment, we focus on predictive model of a classification problem on the supplier risk dataset. We implemented graphical exploration and fitted four models including logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine and neural network. After performance comparison using different metrics, we further tuned model using optimal decision threshold.
* **Assignment4**: In this assignment, we covered two part. We built unsupervised learning model using k-means on supplier audit dataset in part1 and solved a linear programming problem in part2.
